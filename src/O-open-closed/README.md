# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

## Definition

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Key Points

- You should be able to extend a class's behavior without modifying it
- Use abstraction to allow different implementations
- Achieve extensibility through inheritance, interfaces, and composition
- Protects existing code from changes

## Coming Soon

TypeScript examples demonstrating good and bad practices for the Open/Closed Principle will be added here.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Risk**: Existing code doesn't need to be modified
2. **Better Extensibility**: New functionality can be added easily
3. **Improved Stability**: Less chance of introducing bugs in working code
