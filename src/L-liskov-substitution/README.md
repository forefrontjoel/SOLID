# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## Definition

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Key Points

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Derived classes must not strengthen preconditions
- Derived classes must not weaken postconditions
- Maintain the behavioral contract of the base class

## Coming Soon

TypeScript examples demonstrating proper inheritance and substitutability will be added here.

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Inheritance**: Ensures inheritance is used correctly
2. **Polymorphism**: Enables safe use of polymorphic behavior
3. **Contract Compliance**: Maintains expected behavior across type hierarchy
