# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

## Definition

No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## Key Points

- Keep interfaces small and focused
- Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones
- Clients should only know about methods they actually use
- Avoid "fat" interfaces with many methods

## Coming Soon

TypeScript examples demonstrating interface design and segregation will be added here.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Coupling**: Clients depend only on what they need
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to unused methods don't affect clients
3. **Clearer Contracts**: Interfaces have focused, specific purposes
