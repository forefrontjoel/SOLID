# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Definition

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

## Key Points

- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Use dependency injection to provide implementations
- Invert the direction of dependencies
- High-level policy should not depend on low-level details

## Coming Soon

TypeScript examples demonstrating dependency injection and inversion of control will be added here.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Coupling**: High-level modules are independent of low-level details
2. **Better Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for testing
3. **Improved Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations
